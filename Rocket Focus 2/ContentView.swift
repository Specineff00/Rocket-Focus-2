 This app's will help the user maintain his focus for the time when studying using pomodoroing
 
 This app should:
 - Start a count down of 25 minutes
 - Alert the user when the 25 minutes is up
 - Be able to tell when it has completed a 25 minute session and subsequently start the 5 min timer once the user
 has stopped the alert
 - Be able to alert the user at the end of the 5 minutes
 - Be able to pause the 5 and 25 minute timer at any time.
 - Increment the amount of times the user has completed a cycle of 25 mins
 - Be able to tell when it's the 4th pomodoro and show 15min break
 
 Exploration - Before app making. NO TCA or arch
 - Can a timer exist when locked. âœ…
 - Can the app detect when home is pressed or dismissed. âœ…
 - Can the app detect when locked. âœ…
 - Can detect when dismissed and then locked ðŸ¤”
